# SQLite Custom Builds

## Reason

Because the official SQLite APT distro is always years old.

## To Do

* **[â€“]** Avoid duplication of this [`build-sqlite3`](https://github.com/loveencounterflow/sqlite3-customized/blob/main/build-sqlite3)
    and [the same used in `dbay`](https://github.com/loveencounterflow/dbay/blob/master/build-sqlite3)

## Is Done

* **[+]** POC: first compilation
